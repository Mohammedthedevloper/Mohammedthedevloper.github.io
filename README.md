# Portfolio — Your Name

This is a small, static portfolio page scaffold. It includes a responsive layout, theme toggle, and placeholder content you can replace.

How to use

- Open `index.html` in your browser to view the page.
- Or serve it locally (recommended) using Python's simple server:

```powershell
# from the project root (C:/Users/User/MyPortfolio)
python -m http.server 8000
# then open http://localhost:8000 in your browser
```

Files added

- `index.html` — the main page
- `styles.css` — styles with light/dark variables
- `script.js` — small interactive helpers (theme, nav, year)
- `README.md` — this file

Next steps / customization

- Replace "Your Name" and the placeholder email with your real info.
- Replace project cards with real project links, screenshots, and descriptions.
- Swap the avatar placeholder with your image (update HTML/CSS).
- Add analytics or contact integration if desired.

If you'd like, I can:
- Customize colors, fonts, or layout.
- Add a resume download link, project modal previews, or a contact API handler.
